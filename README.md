## Project Overview
New York City Airbnb listings data from the last 12 months will be used to predict future prices for rental locations in the city's neighborhoods and boroughs. This topic was selected due to the team's interest in exploring the short-term rental market and the availability of New York City's Airbnb listing data from Inside Airbnb. Inside Airbnb provides data, information, and advocacy on Airbnb's residential communities impact so that communities can understand, decide and control the role of renting residential homes to tourists. 

The listings datasets consist of over 38,000 listings and 18 variables that provide useful metrics and information to visualize trends. The datasets will first be sourced, downloaded, and prepared for analysis. (Python and Pandas) will be used to clean, prepare, and perform exploratory data analysis. Database integration (Postgres, MongoDB, or SQLite) will then be used to store the cleaned data. Machine learning will then be applied to predcit the prices for (timeline?) and the findings will be presented in a dashboard (Tableau, JavaScript). 

Questions the team hopes to answer with the data:
- ?

## Results
- Description of the data exploration phase of the project
- Description of the analysis phase of the project


## Machine Learning Model
Team members present a provisional machine learning model that stands in for the final machine learning model and accomplishes the following:
- Takes in data in from the provisional database 
- Outputs label(s) for input data

How did you select the model, and why? What roadblocks did you encounter and how did you solve them?


## Database
Team members present a provisional database that stands in for the final database and accomplishes the following: 
- Sample data that mimics the expected final database structure or schema 
- Draft machine learning module is connected to the provisional database
