## Project Overview
New York City Airbnb listings data will be used to perform predictive analysis to identify the factors that influences room price. This topic was selected due to the team's interest in exploring the short-term rental market and the availability of New York City's Airbnb listing data from Inside Airbnb. Inside Airbnb provides data, information, and advocacy on Airbnb's residential communities impact so that communities can understand, decide and control the role of renting residential homes to tourists. 

The listings datasets consist of over 38,000 listings and 18 variables that provide useful metrics and information to visualize trends. The datasets will first be sourced, downloaded, and prepared for analysis. Python and Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform exploratory data analysis. PostgreSQL and pgAdmin will be used for database integration and to store the cleaned data. Machine learning will then be applied to predict room prices. Finally, the findings will be presented in a Tableau dashboard. 

Questions the team hopes to answer with the data:
- What is the most popular borough?
- what are the more frequently rented neighborhoods in each borough? (Top 5)
- What is the most frequent rental room type?
- Does the amount of short-term rentals increase or decrease with the 30-day rental policy?
- Correlation analysis 
    - between price and room type
    - between price and borough 
    - between price and neighborhood
    - between price and number of reviews
    - between price and last reviewed date 
- Optional: Use latitude and longtide to calculate distance from landmarks? 
- Optional: Use the 03-JUN-2022 Listings dataset to compare prices in different seasons?

## Communication Protocols 
The team communicated through a designated Slack Group Channel and pre-determined meeting times.

- Description of the analysis phase of the project


## Machine Learning Model
Team members present a provisional machine learning model that stands in for the final machine learning model and accomplishes the following:
- Takes in data in from the provisional database 
- Outputs label(s) for input data

**How did you select the model, and why? What roadblocks did you encounter and how did you solve them?**

**Random Forest Regression:**  This model selects the popular answer out of a series of potential options. We will use this model for determining the most popular borough and most frequent rental room type. 

**Linear Regression:** We selected this model to help us answer the correlation analysis questions and to determine if the amount of short-term rentals increases or decreases with the 30-day rental policy. 

**Neural Network:** This model allows us to input a series of variables to provide us with the top 5 frequently rented neighborhoods in each borough. 



## Database
Team members present a provisional database that stands in for the final database and accomplishes the following: 
- Sample data that mimics the expected final database structure or schema 
- Draft machine learning module is connected to the provisional database



## Dashboard
Findings will be presented in a Tableau dashboard. 


## Conclusion
- Recommendation for future analysis
- Anything the team would have done differently
